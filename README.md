# Simple Java Calculator ðŸ§®

This repo contains two basic Java calculator programs built to practice OOP concepts, user input handling, and file operations in Java.

## 1. `SimpleCalculator.java`
A basic calculator that:
- Takes **two numbers**
- Performs operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**
- Runs in a loop until the user exits
- Keeps a **history** of your calculations
- Lets you **view the history**
- Can **generate a `.txt` file** of all previous operations

## 2. `SimpleCalculatorWithVariousInput.java`
An enhanced version that:
- Accepts **multiple inputs** (not just two)
- Performs:
  - **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication**
  - **History tracking**
  - **.txt file generation** for previous results
- Uses clean OOP structure with:
  - `LogicHandling` class â€“ handles UI & inputs
  - `CalculatorFunction` class â€“ handles core operations and history
